                                                               Difference between Window Vs Document Object :

Window                                                         				                 Document
It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.           It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
                                                        
It is loaded inside the window.                                                              It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.                                                                           
                                                        
It is the object of the browser.                                                             It is the object of window property.                        
                                                        
Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.     All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
                                                        
We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window                            We can access the document from a window using the window. document                            
                                                        
The window is part of BOM, not DOM.                                                          The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
                                                        
Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.                   Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title                                     
syntax:                                                                                      syntax:
window.propertyname;                                                                         document.propertyname;

example:                                                                                     example:
window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser.              document.title :  will return the title of the document.
